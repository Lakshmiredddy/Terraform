# Terraform

âœ… Benefits of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Version Control
Enables:

Change tracking
Code reviews
Collaboration using Git
Rollbacks and audits
CRUD Operations Simplified
Easy to Create, Read, Update, and Delete infrastructure through code.

Consistency Across Environments
Avoid the "works in dev, fails in prod" issue by replicating the same infra in every environment.

Inventory Management
Easily understand what resources are in use by reading the code.

Cost Efficiency

Automatically shut down resources during non-business hours.
Schedule start/stop based on usage.
Dependency Management
Automatically handles relationships between resources (e.g., attach an instance to a VPC or subnet).

Modular Approach
Use reusable Terraform modules for better code structure and DRY principles.
