## ‚úÖ Benefits of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Version Control**  
  Enables:
  - Change tracking
  - Code reviews
  - Collaboration using Git
  - Rollbacks and audits

- **CRUD Operations Simplified**  
  Easy to Create, Read, Update, and Delete infrastructure through code.

- **Consistency Across Environments**  
  Avoid the "works in dev, fails in prod" issue by replicating the same infra in every environment.

- **Inventory Management**  
  Easily understand what resources are in use by reading the code.

- **Cost Efficiency**  
  - Automatically shut down resources during non-business hours.
  - Schedule start/stop based on usage.

- **Dependency Management**  
  Automatically handles relationships between resources (e.g., attach an instance to a VPC or subnet).

- **Modular Approach**  
  Use reusable Terraform modules for better code structure and DRY principles.
